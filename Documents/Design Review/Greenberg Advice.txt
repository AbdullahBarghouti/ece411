Questions for Andrew:
•	USB Power pin
o	Will it cause problems if it’s not connected?
o	Can we get away with not using it? Just using power from the DC barrel jack
•	Enabling internal pull-up resistors on digital pins

Advice from Andrew
•	Get something you don’t have to wire up for ISP programming – get a cord designed for the 2x3 pin header
•	For I2C, 4.7k for pull up resistor is standard.
•	Want GND plane on both sides
•	Stitching vias – add via, name it GND, then copy and paste around.
